# System Patterns

## Architecture
The application follows a **Manager-Component** architecture pattern, incorporating best practices for asynchronous operations, performance, cross-platform compatibility, and security.

### Core Design Pattern
- **Managers**: Handle business logic and data operations (e.g., TerminalManager, MarkdownManager, LLMManager, PluginManager). These should be designed with considerations for asynchronous processing, error handling, and security.
- **UI Components**: Render interface elements and handle user interactions (e.g., TerminalTab, MarkdownTab, AITab, PluginTab). Components should be optimized for performance, handle updates efficiently, and provide clear user feedback including loading indicators and error displays.
- **Main Application**: Orchestrates the overall user experience (`CTFToolkitApp`), managing the interactions between Managers and UI Components and ensuring adherence to cross-platform compatibility and security guidelines.

## Component Relationships
- The Main Application (`CTFToolkitApp`) orchestrates the various Managers and UI Components.
- UI Components interact with Managers to perform actions and display data. For example, `TerminalTab` interacts with `TerminalManager` to execute commands, incorporating incremental output streaming and input sanitization.
- Dependencies should be managed carefully, with optional features isolated using lazy imports.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- Asynchronous operations are critical for non-blocking behavior, especially for command execution and LLM API calls. Implementing `async/await` best practices, including using worker threads for blocking operations and streaming output, is essential.
- The interaction between UI Components and Managers for data flow and updates must be performant, utilizing techniques like output virtualization and update throttling for large datasets.
- Cross-platform compatibility must be ensured through the use of Textual's `Driver` abstraction and thorough testing of keybindings.
- Secure handling of configurations and subprocesses is paramount, prioritizing environment variables for sensitive information and sanitizing command inputs.
- Robust error handling and testing strategies, including mocking subprocesses and structured logging, are critical for application stability and debugging.
- The architecture should be future-proof, particularly for integrating external services like LLMs through abstract interfaces.
