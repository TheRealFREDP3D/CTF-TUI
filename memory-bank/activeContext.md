# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Updating the memory bank to reflect the current state, next steps, and insights based on the recommendations from 'v0.1.2-Recommendations.md'.

## Recent Changes
Updated memory bank files:
- `projectbrief.md`
- `productContext.md`
- `techContext.md`
- `activeContext.md`

## Next Steps
- Implement Async/Await best practices (worker threads, incremental output streaming).
- Apply performance optimizations (virtualization, throttling).
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Driver abstraction, keybinding testing).
- Refine dependency management (lazy imports, config validation).
- Enhance error handling and UX (graceful fallbacks, loading indicators).
- Strengthen security and configuration (environment variables for API keys, input sanitization).
- Improve testing and debugging practices (subprocess mocking, structured logging).
- Integrate LiteLLM for LLM abstraction.
- Plan for packaging and distribution with PyInstaller.
- Create comprehensive documentation, including a TUI cheat sheet.
- Real LLM API integration (incorporating LiteLLM).
- Plugin auto-discovery and installation.
- Configuration file management (implementing validation and secure handling).
- Persistent session data.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the project state and incorporates the latest recommendations and information about LiteLLM.
- Prioritizing the implementation of recommendations based on their impact on production readiness and user experience.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The virtual environment activated with `source .venv/Scripts/activate` persists within a terminal session.
- Adhering to the Async/Await, performance, cross-platform, dependency management, error handling, security, testing, and architectural recommendations from 'v0.1.2-Recommendations.md', and incorporating LiteLLM for LLM handling.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project has a clear Manager-Component architecture.
- Asynchronous programming is a core aspect of the project.
- There is a well-defined list of features and future requirements, now supplemented by detailed technical recommendations and the decision to use LiteLLM for LLM abstraction.
