# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the memory bank based on existing project documentation.

## Recent Changes
Created initial memory bank files:
- `projectbrief.md`
- `productContext.md`
- `systemPatterns.md`
- `techContext.md`
- `progress.md`

## Next Steps
Focus on implementing the production readiness requirements outlined in `progress.md`. The immediate next steps are:
- Real LLM API integration
- Plugin auto-discovery and installation
- Configuration file management
- Persistent session data
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Performance optimization for large outputs
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the project state.
- Prioritizing the production readiness requirements.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The virtual environment activated with `source .venv/Scripts/activate` persists within a terminal session.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project has a clear Manager-Component architecture.
- Asynchronous programming is a core aspect of the project.
- There is a well-defined list of features and future requirements.
