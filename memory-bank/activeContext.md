# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Analyzing and incorporating recommendations from 'v0.1.2-Recommendations.md' into the memory bank and project development plan.

## Recent Changes
Updated memory bank files:
- `projectbrief.md`
- `productContext.md`

## Next Steps
Prioritize implementing the recommendations from 'v0.1.2-Recommendations.md' to enhance the application's robustness, performance, and user experience. Specific next steps include:
- Implementing Async/Await best practices (worker threads, incremental output streaming).
- Applying performance optimizations (virtualization, throttling).
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility (Driver abstraction, keybinding testing).
- Refining dependency management (lazy imports, config validation).
- Enhancing error handling and UX (graceful fallbacks, loading indicators).
- Strengthening security and configuration (environment variables for API keys, input sanitization).
- Improving testing and debugging practices (subprocess mocking, structured logging).
- Abstracting LLM providers for a future-proof architecture.
- Planning for packaging and distribution with PyInstaller.
- Creating comprehensive documentation, including a TUI cheat sheet.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring the memory bank accurately reflects the project state and incorporates the latest recommendations.
- Prioritizing the implementation of recommendations based on their impact on production readiness and user experience.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- The virtual environment activated with `source .venv/Scripts/activate` persists within a terminal session.
- Adhering to the Async/Await, performance, cross-platform, dependency management, error handling, security, testing, and architectural recommendations from 'v0.1.2-Recommendations.md'.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The project has a clear Manager-Component architecture.
- Asynchronous programming is a core aspect of the project.
- There is a well-defined list of features and future requirements, now supplemented by detailed technical recommendations.
