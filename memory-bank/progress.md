# Progress

## Current Status
The project is currently a Proof of Concept demonstrating core functionality. The recommendations from 'v0.1.2-Recommendations.md' have been analyzed and documented across the memory bank files, providing a clear technical direction for achieving production readiness.

### Completed Features
- ✅ Functional terminal command execution
- ✅ Live markdown editing and preview
- ✅ Mock AI assistant responses
- ✅ Plugin status display
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Analysis and documentation of v0.1.2 recommendations

## What's Left to Build (Implementing Recommendations & Production Readiness)
- Implement Async/Await best practices (worker threads, incremental output streaming).
- Apply performance optimizations (virtualization, throttling).
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Driver abstraction, keybinding testing).
- Refine dependency management (lazy imports, config validation).
- Enhance error handling and UX (graceful fallbacks, loading indicators).
- Strengthen security and configuration (environment variables for API keys, input sanitization).
- Improve testing and debugging practices (subprocess mocking, structured logging).
- Abstract LLM providers for a future-proof architecture.
- Plan for packaging and distribution with PyInstaller.
- Create comprehensive documentation, including a TUI cheat sheet.
- Real LLM API integration (incorporating abstraction).
- Plugin auto-discovery and installation.
- Configuration file management (implementing validation and secure handling).
- Persistent session data.

## Known Issues
- (To be documented as they arise during implementation of recommendations)
