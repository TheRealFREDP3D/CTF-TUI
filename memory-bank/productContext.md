# Product Context

## Purpose
The CTF Toolkit aims to streamline Capture The Flag (CTF) competition workflows by providing a single, integrated Terminal User Interface (TUI).

## Problems Solved
- Reduces the need to switch between multiple tools and terminals during CTFs.
- Provides an integrated environment for terminal operations, note-taking, AI assistance, and tool management.

## How it Should Work
The application should provide a seamless TUI experience with different tabs for core functionalities. Users should be able to execute commands, take notes, get AI assistance, and manage tools within the same interface. The application should provide clear feedback during operations, including loading indicators for asynchronous tasks and graceful handling and display of errors within the TUI.

## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive keyboard navigation.
- Real-time feedback for command execution and markdown preview.
- Easy access to integrated tools and AI assistance.
- Clear and actionable error messages displayed within the TUI.
- Visual indication of ongoing processes using loading indicators.
- Comprehensive documentation, including a TUI cheat sheet for keybindings and status indicators.

## Target Use Cases
1. CTF Competition Participation: Integrated workspace for challenge solving.
2. Security Research: Combined terminal, notes, and AI assistance.
3. Educational Environments: Teaching cybersecurity concepts.
4. Penetration Testing: Workflow organization and documentation.
