## User Experience Goals
- Intuitive keyboard navigation.
- Real-time feedback for command execution and markdown preview.
- Easy access to integrated tools and AI assistance.

## Target Use Cases
1. CTF Competition Participation: Integrated workspace for challenge solving.
2. Security Research: Combined terminal, notes, and AI assistance.
3. Educational Environments: Teaching cybersecurity concepts.
4. Penetration Testing: Workflow organization and documentation.
